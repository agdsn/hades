Hades is the authentication and authorization system of the AG DSN residential
network/student network.
It is a distributed system that provides RADIUS MAC authentication (also called
MAC Authentication Bypass on Cisco devices) to authenticate users via switches
that support it and offers the most essential networking services, DHCP and DNS,
for authenticated users.
Hades includes a basic captive portal that explains to unauthenticated users why
their authentication attempt failed.

External services may be integrated into the captive portal to e.g. allow user
to login with user account into a user management interface, a web mail
interface, or sign up via a web interface.
